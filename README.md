# Project 3: Quiz App
This project is project 3 in Grow with Google's Android Basic Nanodegree course @ Udacity. 

### Prerequisites

1. I had been following the lectures to make an interactive android app as part of Udacity's Grow With Google Anroid Basics Nanodegree [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)
2. Download this repository and use Android Studio IDE to run the project locally via USB connected Android phone or Android Studio's AVD Manager.

### Learning Milestone

At this point, the app demonstrates the learners ability to make use of resource xml files, e.g. dimens.xml, string.xml, colors.xml, etc ... instead of embedding values within the activity_main.xml layout file. The learner also, learns to use additional elements like radioroups, radiobuttons, checkboxes, and toasts, to control user input and run java methods from MainActivity.java

### Screenshot Recording
